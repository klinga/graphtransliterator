Graph Transliterator's developers acknowledge the following open-access projects, which
have been particularly helpful in Graph Transliterator's development. These include:
astropy_ (guide for documentation style expanding on numpy_), contributor_covenant_
(basis for the code of conduct), `cookiecutter-pypackage` (initial Python module
template), jupyter-sphinx_ (excellent renderer of live code results in the docs), and
`marshmallow` (fantastic object serializer/deserializer and general model of good
coding).

Those from which code/text has been adopted are mentioned in `NOTICE`_.
