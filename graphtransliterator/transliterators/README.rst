==============================
Bundled Transliterators--DRAFT
==============================
This directory contains bundled transliterators. The root directory contains the
transliterators as YAML files. The subdirectory `tests` contains tests for each
transliterator.

If you are creating a transliterator, see the `sample` subdirectory.

# A test is required, and it must have complete coverage of the
# graph, meaning every node must be visited over the course of the tests.

Naming Conventions
------------------
Easy-reading YAML file, if used: `./SOURCE_TO_TARGET/SOURCE_to_TARGET.yaml`
# JSON file: `./SOURCE_TO_TARGET/SOURCE_to_TARGET.json` - generated by script?
# Initialization file: `./SOURCE_TO_TARGET/__init__.py`?
Test file: `./SOURCE_TO_TARGET/tests/SOURCE_TO_TARGET.py`
# Long Description file: SOURCE_TO_TARGET/SOURCE_TO_TARGET.rst

Metadata Requirements
---------------------
Each transliterator can include the following metadata fields. These fields are a
subset of `setuptools`. Long descriptions are not currently included.

name (`str`)
  Name of the transliterator. It must match the name of the YAML file. If possible,
  it should be in lowercase and follow the format: `SOURCE_to_TARGET.yaml`, where
  `SOURCE` is the original script/language/etc. and `TARGET` is the destination
  script/language/etc.
version	(`str`, optional)
  Version of the transliterator. Semantic versioning (https://semver.org) is
  strongly recommended.
url	(`str`, optional)
  URL for the transliterator, e.g. Git. repository.
author (`str`, optional)
  Author of the transliterator
author_email (`str`, optional)
  E-mail address of the author.
maintainer (`str`, optional)
  Name of the maintainer.
maintainer_email (`str`, optional)
  E-mail address of the maintainer.
license (`str`, optional)
  License of the transliterator. An open-source license is required for inclusion in
  this project.
